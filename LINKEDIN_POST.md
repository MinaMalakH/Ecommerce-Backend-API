🚀 Excited to share my latest open-source project: E-Commerce Backend API

I've built a modern, production-ready RESTful API that handles everything an e-commerce platform needs:

✨ **Key Features:**
✅ Secure JWT authentication with refresh tokens
✅ Complete CRUD for products, categories, orders & reviews
✅ Admin dashboard with real-time analytics
✅ Cloudinary integration for image uploads
✅ Role-based access control (User/Admin)
✅ Email verification & password management
✅ Advanced search, filtering & pagination

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
• Node.js + Express
• MongoDB with Mongoose
• JWT for authentication
• Cloudinary for image storage
• Joi for validation
• Nodemailer for emails

📊 **What's Included:**
→ 27+ API endpoints
→ Complete documentation
→ Postman collection (ready to test)
→ MIT License (open for contributions)
→ Clean MVC architecture
→ Global error handling

This project demonstrates best practices in backend development:
• Separation of concerns (Controllers/Services/Models)
• Secure authentication flows
• Database optimization
• Input validation & error handling
• Environment-based configuration

Perfect for anyone looking to understand backend architecture or use it as a foundation for their e-commerce platform!

Building an E-Commerce Backend API 🏗️

I'm sharing something I've been working on for the past few weeks - a complete, production-ready backend API for e-commerce platforms. Here's what I learned along the way:

📝 **The Challenge:**
E-commerce requires handling complex workflows - managing products, orders, inventory, user authentication, and payments all in a secure, scalable way. I wanted to build something that demonstrates best practices while solving real-world problems.

💡 **The Solution:**
I built a robust REST API using Node.js & Express with:
• JWT-based authentication (access + refresh tokens)
• Role-based authorization (admin features)
• Real-time inventory management
• Admin dashboard with analytics
• Email notifications
• Cloudinary integration for images

🏗️ **Architecture Highlights:**
• Clean separation of concerns (Controllers → Services → Models)
• Joi validation for all inputs
• Global error handling
• Environment-based configurations
• Comprehensive logging

📊 **By the Numbers:**
27+ endpoints | 6 main features | Complete documentation | MIT licensed

🚀 **What This Taught Me:**
→ The importance of clean architecture early on
→ Security should never be an afterthought
→ Proper validation prevents 90% of bugs
→ Documentation is as important as code
→ Open source collaboration is invaluable

This project is open source and I'm actively looking for contributors. Whether you're building your own e-commerce platform or want to learn backend development, I'd love your feedback and contributions!
